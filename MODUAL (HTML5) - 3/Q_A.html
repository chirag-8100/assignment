It has greater accessibility. It offers a better user experience.In web design, a semantic element is an element with intrinsic or inherent meaning which represents that meaning to both the browser and the developer. HTML5 introduced semantic tags that allow you to define an element’s purpose on your site. For example, the Nav tag defines navigation links, and the Main tag defines the main content of a web page (also called “the document”). In contrast, the Div tag has no semantic meaning, so Div blocks aren’t considered semantic elements.
